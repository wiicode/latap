# About this project

Working name for this project is LATAP: Leave a Twenty At Party.  LATAP is a spontaneous act of gratitude. It is an attempt at the codification of gestures into a more universally understandable and accepted form.

The objective is that if you are attending a party - where gifts are customary (even if declined) - you can leave a twenty dollar bill as an act of kindness or contribution to the effort to the hosts.   

The purpose of LATAP is to formalize and promote a culture of kindness and appreciation in a way that is both personal and communal, potentially filling a niche in social etiquette that is currently underserved.  

# Core Tenants

**Simplicity**, **discretion**, and **hospitality** are they key components of this project.  While you are encouraged to be ready with a `note and cash` to complete your submission as a guest, and the host should be open to acceptance of the LATAP, the choice to do so and the circumstances require authenticity and serendipity.  

## Rules Engine

1. Ephemeral transaction. 
2. Unadvertised and unasked.
3. Discreet in the moment and thereafter.
4. Hand written note (example)
5. Cash only.

# Dependences

1. Hosts have made everyone feel welcome.
2. Event was as good, or better, than anticipated.
3. There was no preemption or expectation. 

# Common Failures

- Readiness is processed as intention or preemption. 
- Subroutines due to Expectation or Obligation
- Informational messages displayed to other users. 
- Cashless payments. 

# Alternatives 

- Thoughtful gift for the honoree.
- Participation in prep or cleanup effort. 
- Food or drink contributions.
- Cost-sharing. 
# Example Use Cases

- Kids event at a paid venue.
- Sport event in a home where food and drinks were great.
- Informal cookout or dinner where everyone got more then they expected.
- Service staff worked hard and deserve tip or gratuity.
## Example Note:
> Thanks for the birthday party.  We had a good time and noticed the kitchen staff working extra hard to clean up after the kids.  Please accept this as a token of our appreciation.
